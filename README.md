## Problem Statement

# Classifying emotions using images

## Learn facial expressions from an image

Your task is categorize each face based on the emotion shown in the facial expression into one of seven categories `(0=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral)`. 

The data consists of 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces. The faces have been automatically registered so that the face is more or less centered and occupies about the same amount of space in each image.

## Additional Information

The data consists of 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces. The faces have been automatically registered so that the face is more or less centered and occupies about the same amount of space in each image.

The training set consists of 28,709 examples and the test set consists of 3,589 examples.

You can find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013?select=test).

To give you an example of the data you will be dealing with

To test your model further you can use the data collected from the *Extended Cohn-Kanade [dataset](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/ck)*- Note this is facial recognition as well, but ensure that the images are preprocessed to account for your trained model.

# Organize Your Project

- Save your notebooks to Ed workspace.
- The notebook should read like a report with appropriate comments and explanations.
  - Describe the organization of the codes.
  - Include an illustration/flow chart of your model. They can also be used for your presentation.
  - Describe what libraries your codes depend on.
  - If your codes require specific environment configurations, make sure to explain them.

- We won't go through your code line by line, but keeping your code organized and well-documented saves yourselves a lot of trouble and confusion, especially when you are working in groups.
- Make a 5 minutes video presentation of your work and a poster and upload it on ed. 
- **The notebook should read like a report with necessary markdown and comments for code.**

## Presentation Video Template / Outline

## Length 

- Your presentation should have 7-10 slides of content.
- You can have 1 more slide in addition to the content slides for the title page.

Your presentation video should be structured as follows:

## Introduction

- Describe the problem
- Explain your approach to the problem
- Explain briefly how your chosen algorithms work

## Methodology

- Describe your dataset, emphasizing the data added by you. 
- Describe your code (what packages you used, anything new that you wrote)
- **DO NOT** present any code!

## Results

- Present your results
- Describe their meaning

## Conclusions

- Discuss what you learned from the problem
- Speculate on any improvements that can be made

## Poster Template/Outline

We want to make this as real as possible for you! So you will be creating posters and presenting your work to your fellow classmates and professor as well! We will inform you about the logistics soon on the forum.

The poster template is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fIHADtZ8UQGs95_aMU_PbfOcaAgfVO1M/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=102871071182306906420&rtpof=true&sd=true) and can be found as an attachment below.

The idea of a poster is to be as crisp and clean as possible. So do not overload your posters with information.
